### Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is intermediate level and designed to help you become productive at building full-stack Flutter apps. It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of programming, ideally in a language similar to JavaScript, C#, or Java. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 


### Test Drive

You can download the app we're building on the App Store, so give it a test drive before enroll.
