## Use-Cases for Services

Services can can inject shared data and methods into your components. They are also useful for writing code that maintains a DRY separation of concerns. 

- Shared state. Services can connect data between components and are especially useful when components are not in a child/parent relationship. 
- Shared logic. Stateless services that define common methods used in multiple components.
