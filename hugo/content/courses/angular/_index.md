**Angular Firebase PWA Course** will teach you how to build a complex progressive web app with Angular 8, Material Design, Firebase, and deploy it with server-side rendering on Google Cloud Run.

## 🍱 What will I build?

You will build a full-stack [Kanban (看板)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) storyboard app inspired by Trello. Users can drag-and-drop boards.

- Prerendering and/or deployment to Google Cloud Run 

### 🤔 Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is intermediate level and designed to expose you to real-world challenges when building PWAs with Angular. It assumes you have at least basic knowledge of programming, ideally in a language similar to JavaScript, C#, or Java. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 


### 🏎️ Test Drive

Visit the [Firestarter demo app](https://firestarter.fireship.io/) and install it as a PWA to give it a test drive before you enroll.
