## üïäÔ∏è What will I Learn?

- Unit testing rules


## ü§î Is this Course Right for Me?

This course is designed for experienced Firebase developers. It assumes you have built or are currently building a Firebase app, with the intention of shipping it without security vulernatbilies. It is fast-paced and similar to [my style on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA?), but far more in-depth and comprehensive. 


## Is this Course Updated?

The last code review and update was completed on **November 23rd, 2020** using Firebase rules version `2.0`. The course receives regular updates, especially to address breaking changes Firebase.
