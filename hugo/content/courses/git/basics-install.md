## Windows Installation

On Windows, I recommend downloading [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In addition, you may want to use git-bash as your terminal (like me), but that is optional. 


## Mac Installation

On MacOS, I recommend installing git with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

{{< file "terminal" "command line" >}}
```bash
brew install git
```

## Linux Installation

See install instructions for [Linux](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
